# Macaque Charts Figures Code

This repo contains code to replicate the figures in Brain Charts for the Rhesus Macaque Lifespan

### Figure 1: Global tissue type lifespan curves

- Demographic information boxplots
- Tissue type scatterplots
- Tissue type normalized centile curves
- Tissue type site specific curves
- Tissue type growth plots

### Figure 2: Global morphometric lifespan curves and growth surfaces

- Morphometric scatterplots
- Morphometric centile curves
- Morphometric growth rates
- Surface plots of regional growth rates at total gray volume peak

### Figure 3: Cross-species lifespan curves

- Human growth charts (Bethlehem & Seidlitz et. al., 2022)
- Macaque growth charts
- Surface plots of proportional regional growth

### Figure 4: Regional peaks and Meta-analysis

- Macaque regional peak
- Human regional peak
- Difference peak maps
- Cytoarchitecture summary
- Neurosynth growth decoding

### Figure 5: Cross-species mapper

- Example usage of exploring human and macaque [regional growth charts across the lifespan](https://interspeciesmap.childmind.org/)
