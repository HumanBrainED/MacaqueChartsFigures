# Macaque Charts Figures Code

This repo contains code to replicate the figures in Brain Charts for the Rhesus Macaque Lifespan.

Lifespan models were fit using Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS). A wrapper for the R implementation of GAMLSS was used specifically for modeling age-related brain changes over the lifespan, first built and used by Richard Bethlehem and Jakob Seidlitz for Brain Charts for the Human Lifespan (Bethlehem & Seidlitz, 2022).
